function [y_est, var_est] = my_gmr(Priors, Mu, Sigma, X, in, out)
%MY_GMR This function performs Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR), using the 
% parameters of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for a D-dimensional dataset,
% for D= N+P, where N is the dimensionality of the inputs and P the 
% dimensionality of the outputs.
%
% Inputs -----------------------------------------------------------------
%   o Priors:  1 x K array representing the prior probabilities of the K GMM 
%              components.
%   o Mu:      D x K array representing the centers of the K GMM components.
%   o Sigma:   D x D x K array representing the covariance matrices of the 
%              K GMM components.
%   o x:       N x M array representing M datapoints of N dimensions.
%   o in:      1 x N array representing the dimensions of the GMM parameters
%                to consider as inputs.
%   o out:     1 x P array representing the dimensions of the GMM parameters
%                to consider as outputs. 
% Outputs ----------------------------------------------------------------
%   o y_est:     P x M array representing the retrieved M datapoints of 
%                P dimensions, i.e. expected means.
%   o var_est:   P x P x M array representing the M expected covariance 
%                matrices retrieved.
